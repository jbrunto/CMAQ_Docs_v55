# Getting Started

There are many resources available for learning about the CMAQ system.  This table will help you find the right starting place for your situation. 

|**I want to ...**|**Start with**|
|:--------------|:----|
|... learn about CMAQ's purpose, history and design, as well as see a sample of CMAQ applications. | [US EPA CMAQ Website](https://www.epa.gov/cmaq)|
|... start running the model but am not sure where to start. | [Running a simulation](#getting_running) section below |
|... upgrade to the latest version of CMAQ but I'm not sure how my workflow and results will be impacted. | [Release Frequently Asked Questions](./Release_FAQ/README.md) |
|... see what code changes have happened in a specific section of the model in the last several years. | [CMAQ Release Notes](./Release_Notes/README.md)|
|... run CMAQ on a Cloud Service Provider. | [CMAS Center tutorial for running CMAQ on Amazon Web Services](https://pcluster-cmaq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) |
|... run a new simulation but I need model inputs. |[CMAQ Data](#cmaq_data) section below|
|... find data files with CMAQ estimates of air pollutants including toxics and deposition. | [CMAQ Data](#cmaq_data) section below|
